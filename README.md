# DQN_CartPole

Implementation of a Deep Q Network for the Cartpole problem available in Gymnasium using Pytorch and presenting 2 types of network where in one we use the state vector given by the gym environment while also trying to take inspiration from the Deep Q Learning with Atari paper and use image frames as state information. 

Refer to the notebooks in Code directory and IMT2020045.pdf (Report) to understand the design choices, codebase and observations regarding the experiments performed.
